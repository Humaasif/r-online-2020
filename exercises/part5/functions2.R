# Functions 2 

# Write a function that takes a character vector as input and 
# recodes any values that are not the 3 most frequent values as "Other"

# Then generalize your function to take an additional argument n to specify 
# how many values stay as they are (instead of always 3)

# Challenge: add some error checking to your function: see the stop() function

# Vectors to test your function with
x <- c(letters[1:5], letters[1:5], letters[6:10])
y <- c(month.name, month.name[6:10], month.name[7:12], month.name[5:7])
z <- c("dog", rep("cat", 2), rep("chicken", 3), rep("pig", 4), rep("cow", 5))
